# Indian Food Image Classification üçóü´ìüòã

As part of my **Machine Learning internship with Coding Raja Technologies** , I undertook a comprehensive Food Classification project leveraging cutting-edge techniques to identify and classify different types of food items. The project incorporates `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)` architectures, including `ResNetV2` and `EfficientNetV2`, to achieve accurate and efficient food classification. **EfficientNetV2** achieved the best accuracy `(~85%)` in this project. The model built in this project has the capability of classifying *20* different types of Indian food images including - **'chai', 'chapati', 'chole bhature', 'paani puri'**, etc.

### Features

- **Data preparation:** Robust preprocessing techniques and input pipeline is used to enhance the quality of food images for fast and accurate classification.

- **Deep Learning Models:** Implementation of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including ResNetV2 and EfficientNetV2.

- **EfficientNetV2 Performance:** Through rigorous experimentation, EfficientNetV2 emerged as the top-performing model, achieving the highest accuracy `(~85%)` in food classification.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Various evaluation metrics including `accuracy`, `recall`, `precision` and `f1_acore` are used to assess the performance and accuracy of the classification models.

- **User-friendly streamlit based Interface:** An intuitive streamlit based interface is built for easy exploration of clasifying food images.

To use the streamlit based web app, where I deployed my model :-

```
pyhton -m streamlit run indian_food_classification.py
```
